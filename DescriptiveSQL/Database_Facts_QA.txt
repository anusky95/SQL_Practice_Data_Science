Why do businesses use Database?
-Data Integrity - Correct data entered and by right people who have permissions
-Fast Data Access - Data can be extracted quickly using SQL 
-Shared Data - Multiple individuals can access data stored in database (consistent results)

LOGICAL OPERATORS

LIKE
This allows you to perform operations similar to using WHERE and =, but for cases when you might not know exactly what you are looking for.

IN
This allows you to perform operations similar to using WHERE and =, but for more than one condition.

NOT
This is used with IN and LIKE to select all of the rows NOT LIKE or NOT IN a certain condition.

AND & BETWEEN
These allow you to combine operations where all combined conditions must be true.

OR
This allow you to combine operations where at least one of the combined conditions must be true.

Primary keys - are unique for every row in a table. These are generally the first column in our database (like you saw with the id column for every table in the Parch & Posey database).

foreign keys - are the primary key appearing in another table, which allows the rows to be non-unique.

Choosing the set up of data in our database is very important, but not usually the job of a data analyst. This process is known as Database Normalization.

JOINs
The three JOIN statements you are most likely to use are:

JOIN - an INNER JOIN that only pulls data that exists in both tables.
LEFT JOIN - a way to pull all of the rows from the table in the FROM even if they do not exist in the JOIN statement.
RIGHT JOIN - a way to pull all of the rows from the table in the JOIN even if they do not exist in the FROM statement.
